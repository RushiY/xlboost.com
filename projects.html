        <h2>What We Are Doing</h2>
            <h3>Our mission here at PACit is to improve the government in a way in which it reflects only the direct flow of democracy. We seek to combat gerrymandering, the electoral college, lobbying, big money, corruption, polarization, and other obstacles that our nation faces that have undermined democracy. While seeking to improve democracy, we also wish to empower the voices of the youth in the democratic system, without the power to vote.</h3>

        <h2>Combating Voter Supression</h2>
            <h3>The basic fundamentals of our constitution and legal system guarantee our rights as citizens to vote and engage with the democratic process without the obstacles of voter suppression. But because of the increase of corruption in the democratic process, state political leaders have used fear to prevent millions from having the basic right to vote. At PACit, we seek to end voter suppression and improve the democratic process.</h3>
        <h2>Supporting Political Discourse</h2>
            <h3>Communication and debate are at the foundation of democracy because of their ability to translate all political views into the government. PACit provides an environment for this very debate to seen in the youth as well, to guide a future political system in which cooperation is key. President Barack Obama once said that he could gain the support of any family if he could simply sit down and converse with them, we hope to upstand this code and inject much-needed empathy in current political discourse.</h3>

        <h2>Media Credibility</h2>
            <h3>Recently, politicians and many people have viewed the media as simply "fake", the problem lies with some news organizations, but not media as a whole. At PACit, we value the proper education and informing of American people. Therefore, we hope to work to find unbiased media that is close to truth, fair, balanced, and media that has proper coverage of the current stories. </h3>
